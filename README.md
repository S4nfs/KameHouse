A collection of the most optimized VS Code profiles. Microsoft always struggles with optimization, especially when using GitHub Copilot—VS Code tends to leak memory, making it worse.

Each profile includes necessary extensions and settings to optimize your workflow, with the **Kame-Default** profile providing a comprehensive base setup. Integrate these profiles to enhance your development environment.

## Importing a VS Code Profile from GitHub Gist

To import a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) profile from a GitHub Gist to your local Windows or macOS system, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Gist URL**
2. **Launch Visual Studio Code**
3. **Access the Profile Menu**
   - Click on the gear icon (⚙️) located in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window.
4. **Initiate Profile Import**
   - Navigate to `Profiles > Import Profile...`.
5. **Enter the Gist URL**
   - In the prompt that appears, paste the copied Gist URL and press **Enter**.

## Profiles

- **`KameHouse-Default`**: <pre>'https://gist.github.com/S4nfs/4b7af5ba7db15a7e3ffb6bb987b3ff7b'</pre>  <span><button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('https://gist.github.com/S4nfs/4b7af5ba7db15a7e3ffb6bb987b3ff7b')">Copy URL</button></span>

  _Details: Inspired by Cursor and Project IDX, I use it personally_

#### Post-Installation Steps

After importing a profile, you may need to install the recommended extensions. Search for **Prettier+ by Benas Svipas**, as it is much easier to use and pre-configured. Adjust other extensions and settings as needed to suit your preferences.
